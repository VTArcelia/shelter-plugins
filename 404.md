# VTArcelia's shelter plugins
hosted plugins that are modified from ones that already exist to fit my taste, if you have issues, you can E-Mail me @ VTArcelia@proton.me or message me on discord @VTArcelia (heavily inactive but I do occasionally check.) I do not want to have issues on github as I check here once every month, while everything else is once or twice a week. 

Original Plugins can be found in these repo's;
