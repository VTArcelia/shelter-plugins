# VTArcelia's shelter plugins
hosted plugins that are modified from ones that already exist to fit my taste

Original Plugins can be found in these repo's;
---
Invisible Typing in [SpikeHD's repo](https://github.com/SpikeHD/shelter-plugins) - removes the icon to toggle on the chat bar and perma sets it to off, because let's be real if you are using this plugin in the first place you don't want to have any typing indicator.

Message Keeper Around in [nea89o's repo](https://github.com/nea89o/shelter-plugins) - adds whitelist/blacklist for channelID/userID and edit logging with an option to show the difs between edits, and dismiss message



If you are the original owner of any plugin and want me to delete I will, or if you want to take any of the changes, you can. I don't mind at all nor do I need any credit. This is just what I think they should be done as.



RandomWallpaper: if you are not using Clearvision, and your theme uses something other than --background-image url(imagelink); change the url(imagelink); part to var(--cv-random-wallpaper);
modded-msg-logger: soon fixing dismiss message button
